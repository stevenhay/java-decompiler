# java-decompiler
A basic Java class decompiler written in Go

This project is for me to learn about the Java Class file format and the JVM bytecode instructions. A lot of instructions are currently missing. I am not sure if I will continue this project or not :)

Inspired by a couple of videos I watched by [tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding):
 - [Parsing Java Bytecode with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FmRyv8jTM)
 - [I made JVM in Python just to run "Hello, World"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anOidUQcv1w)
